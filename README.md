# NoktuskaBot

This is a bot made for the Discord App with the initial thought of letting it post new highscores in the game osu!.

This project has grown since I've started it and now goes open-source and public for everyone to use on their own Discord server!

# Features
- Sends new osu! highscores into chat if it has a certain PP value
- Sends notifications if a Twitch streamer goes live
- Comes with other cool commands like "roll"
- Can "mute" people by deleting messages as soon as they were sent

And much more! Look at the full commands list: http://pastebin.com/cJQpD8hp

If you have ANY problems with the bot, contact me on Discord: Noktuska#8520

# Adding it to your server

Adding it is pretty simple:

1. Click on this link https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=181769505884602368&scope=bot (You need to admin to add it to your server)
2. Give his role the permission to delete messages
3. Type "!join" (without quotation marks) to add it to the channel (it needs to have permissions to write/read/join the channel)
4. You're good to go!

Step 2 is optional but allows you to use the mute command if you're really annoyed by some people.
